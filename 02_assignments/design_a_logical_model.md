# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?

In Type 1 SCD, where existing data is overwritten with new values, there's a risk of losing historical information, potentially affecting privacy and data accuracy.

In Type 2 SCD, where historical data is preserved alongside new entries, there's a risk of unauthorized access to past records, which could lead to privacy breaches.

In both cases, careful handling of personally identifiable information (such as customer addresses) is essential to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Failure to protect this data adequately could result in breaches of privacy and trust, as well as legal consequences for the organization.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?

The AdventureWorks ERD offers a robust representation of business domains, encompassing Production, Person, Sales, and Purchasing departments. It provides valuable information on versioning and printing instructions, enhancing its usability. However, it falls short in clarifying column types.

In contrast, my ERD excels in specifying column types, ensuring clear data representation. However, it utilizes only two colors, which may hinder understanding. To improve, I would explore incorporating a more comprehensive color scheme to enhance clarity and facilitate easier comprehension.
